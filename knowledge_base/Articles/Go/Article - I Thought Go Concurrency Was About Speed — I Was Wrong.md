### LinkedIn Post:
I used to think Go concurrency was about making things faster.

Then I wrote a tiny TCP server.

What broke wasn’t performance — it was **availability**.

A single blocking `Accept()` call meant:

- one client connected
- everyone else waited

Adding a goroutine didn’t make the server faster.  
It made the server **usable**.

That’s when concurrency stopped feeling like a language feature and started feeling like a design decision.

I wrote about this realization while evolving a raw TCP server in Go 👇
